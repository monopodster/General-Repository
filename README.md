# General-Repository
Github.com Required My Creating/Naming a "Repository" file(or, if I already have one for another purpose, app, by another name, etc., to emport it from whereever it is...But, for what this is about, or what I'm to do with it???  Answer: As of yet, I have no fucking idea:(
I was also attribute to it whether it is to be Private or Public, I choose who sees it is even there, as well as allow someone to contribute to it, while the Public attrib would allow everyone to see the name and that there is a file there BUT only those I choose can gain access and/or to contribute to it.
IN OTHER WORDS, I am INDEED starting my first "Coding" project since Fortran 101, 102 in 1971, and then again when I wrote that simple program for Bob in year two (of 2) in grad school, speicifically, at University of Michigan's Horrave Rackham School of Graduate Studies, where it took me from 1976-1978 to complete my course load, but all the way to Houston, TX in 1982 to finish my Masters Thesis/Disertation under Dr. Peter Meier, Ph.D, Thesis Advisor and Chairman of the Dept. of Water Quality, in The University of Michigan School of Public Health, despite my graduating from The Univ. of Mich. School of Engineering, Civil Engineering School, Hydrology Lab on U of M's North Campus, under Dr. Walter Weber, who awarded me a M.S.C.E. deploma, i.e., Master of Science, Civil Engineering, majoring in Water Sciences Engineering, Public Health, Urban Planning, Instrumental Analysis, Director of Water Quality Lab's staff scientists, bench chemists, and technicians, and office personel in all aspects of feild collection and analysis of data upon which I would compose and conclude overall condition/status/sumary, conclusions and prognosis of an ecosystem's general health in my academic capacity as cheif expert in charge of all activity in the production of a general Environmental Impact Statement from the "objectivity" of a scientist who is accepting money from anyone who wanted such for any of many possible perspectives, e.g., Monsanto Chem Corporation's V.P. of Corporate Public Relations contracted with my group/lab to show the public and lawmakers that what they are doing is not a danger to their local community, or, I have may have been hired by the Regional Director of The Federal EPA to provide scientific proof that Monsanto Corp's RoundUP Weed Killer production operations is totally lethal to the environment and almost all of its inhabitants now and for centuries to come. And my car payments and mortgage is due, my kids need tuition and expense money for school, bla bla bla, and I ain't got no money UNTIL I FUFIL MY CONTRACTUAL OVLIGATIONS TO MY CLIENTS. So, I began by not taking samples and doing tests that I knew would be bad for my clients, and instead decided that I would not ever outright lie, but that I would not tell the bad shit.  I'd just hold back some things while everything I did conclude was indeed true, justy not relevant, e.g., "...and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I was absolutely unable to show any evidence whatsoever to suggest or imply that my client's production of Glycosate is somehow causing the 95% die off rate of the local pollinating honey bees on land adjacent to the RoundUP Weed Killer manufacturing facilities, at this point in time, seems to be nothing more than coincidence. Possible reasons for such mortality rate in these insects, and the die off of all of the insect pollinated native plant species that supply food that provides for the survival of many of the food pyramid's higher level consumers, the bee population drops have almost certainly played a role in plant and animal diversity in the area, e.g., local insects other than bees are at all time lows, and as well we are seeing mass reductions in the local indiginous bird species which could be starvation due to no plants that used to provide habitats for a wide veriety of insect species the birds traditionally fed on.  Again, however, further toxicity studies are necessary to determine if there may be some environtal toxin that might be contributing to the bee losses, as well as examining many other possible causes such as magnetic pole shifting of the Earth could be interupting essential navigation and communication functions in the bees which might be causing elimination of their primary food sourses getting back to the hive and thus the reduction in bees, insect pollinated plants, ensects living and feeding in/on the missing plants, as well as all types of rodents and birds that feed on these dwindling plant and insect species, and nothing to indicate that any agent or byproduct we are aware of and tested have any effect on control groups of insect sample groups thus indicating that the Glycosate production coming online at approximately the same time the honey bee populations began to drop is no more than an apparent hapenstance of similitude, a mere coincidence, and that until further experimentation is done, it is impossible toconclude or even speculate that the timing of the production facities coming on line can not be causitive to the bee die off at this time, and must remain speculation at best untiil further imperical testing and experimentation cab be done which might illuminate the real causes to the losses seen across all levels of the local food chain trophic level species on land adjacent to the production facilities."
